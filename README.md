## Important for Antminers

Token Farm Controller will scan your local network for available machines.  If you have changed the default password, you will have to click on the SETTINGS button and enter your password for each miner.   These passwords are only stored locally on your local windows machine and are never transmitted outside of your local network.

## Important for GPU Miners

When running Claymore, make sure your command that runs Claymore does not include the <i><b>-mport</b></i> option.  
If your GPU miners is running Claymore on Windows, make sure to set your Firewall to allow Claymore to communicate.
